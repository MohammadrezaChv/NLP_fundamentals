# Word Embedding, Transformer, and Attention Mechanisms in NLP

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including:
- **Word Embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
- **Transformer Architecture**
- **Attention Mechanisms** (Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention)

These implementations are designed to provide insights into the inner workings of modern NLP models and serve as a foundation for further research and development in AI.

## Features
- Implementation of word embedding models
- Custom Transformer architecture from scratch
- Various types of attention mechanisms
- Well-documented code for easy understanding
- Example notebooks for practical use cases

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main scripts for different models:
```bash
python word_embedding.py   # Train word embedding models
python transformer.py      # Train a transformer model
python attention.py        # Explore attention mechanisms
```
